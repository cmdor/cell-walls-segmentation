#Given an image of a cell, distinguish the cell interior, cell wall, and background
`Image segmentation` problem: We will need a way to differentiate micro-features in an RGB digital image, & identify which category each pixel belongs to

#Motivation
`Cell walls` are a key aspect of the structure of most plants, especially ones that humans use for either food or fiber. The wall protects the interior of the cell from diseases and provides the structure necessary for its functionality.Â  As such, it is important for a biologist to understand their structure, which includes aspects like the thickness and relative location relative to other cells. Knowledge of the structure of cells is necessary to understand the quality of the plant as well as the structural integrity of the materials produced.
